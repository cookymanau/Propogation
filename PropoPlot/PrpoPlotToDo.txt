	• Regex instead of if statement in GetQSOsFromList
	• Refactor GetQsosFromList()
	• Google Earth KML plot
	• The 'singlePlot' Live does not stop when I untick it.
	• Can't reliably run two instances of the program on different UDP ports
		○ Is that because we are multiCast instead of singleCast?
	• Add a history of propagation indicator for the continents
		○ Maybe like a little square with a colour in it every 15 minutes?
	• In the compare plots - align the start times some how
	• Get rid of the dots on the All Continents graphs
	• Is the averaging actually averaging?
	• Long run and eventually an all continents plot causes a crash. Array size?  1 hour (270 readings) is OK
	• Upgrade the help dialog boxes to have formatted text
	• Put a compiled version up on Git Hub?
	• Options for line thickness and whether dots or not?
	• A running average for the averages?
	• Statistics like a line that is average +- 1 SD being plotted?  I want to see the trend!!!
	• An option to auto save the file every X minutes would be nice
	• On the Single Plot - keep the current zoom during refreshes
	• Set the scale on the single plot
