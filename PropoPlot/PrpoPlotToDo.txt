	• Added tool controls for line thickness and dot size for the single and compare graphs.
		20210504 Done.  Used Extended.Wpf.Toolkit 4.02

		20210504 I think so.
	• Set the scale on the single plot
		02010504 - done with .plt.axis(null,null,-30,10)  so its autoscaling the X axis

	  rules this time.  Working OK  On the Single Plot - keep the current zoom during refreshes
		20210509
	•  Made the graphLivePlot Options radio buttons instead of check boxes
		20210512
	• Read a previously written file back into memory
	   20200517
	• Put a two cycle lockout on graph menu item to stop trying to access the plots before there is enough data

	• added Zoom to the main interface 20210601
	• Reworked the labelling on the Comparer Graph so you KNOW which line is which
	•



	• Regex instead of if statement in GetQSOsFromList
	• Refactor GetQsosFromList()
	• Google Earth KML plot
	• The 'singlePlot' Live does not stop when I untick it.
	• Can't reliably run two instances of the program on different UDP ports
		○ Is that because we are multiCast instead of singleCast?
	• Add a history of propagation indicator for the continents
		○ Maybe like a little square with a colour in it every 15 minutes?
	• In the compare plots - align the start times some how
	• Get rid of the dots on the All Continents graphs
	• Upgrade the help dialog boxes to have formatted text
	• Put a compiled version up on Git Hub?
	• A running average for the averages?
	• Statistics like a line that is average +- 1 SD being plotted?  I want to see the trend!!!
	• An option to auto save the file every X minutes would be nice
	• Add cat control and a schedule for band changing
	• When I reset the Avgs using the 0 Avgs button - I should also see the averages reset to startup conditions.
	• Single plot-  When you turn off Decodes chk box, then change the Yaxis to -30 to +5
	• DX Atlas keeps grabbing the mouse.  Look for an alternative to plot things.  Simons World Map?
	•Investigate getting Tx receptioon reports.  I want the recption reports from the other guy.  
	  Maybe I can get the result from the RBN network, can get it from the PSK site maybe but its going to be 
	  at least 5minutes old.
	  I can get it fro the ALL.TXT 
	• Add a Heatmap with a world map as the background to replace DX Atlas

	•i want to average the data over 15 minute intervals (4 per hour) and show a 24 bars in a stacked bargraph
	with the data sutably coloured
	•Hilight any decodes from the Usr continent
	•Hilighted decodes by colour.  Colours need to be usere definaeble?
	•Whe you change a continent, lat and long, it needs to update the variables straight away.  At the moment
	I have to stop and start the program
	• Be able to exclude a continent from the Radar Plot - VK6BMW
	• Write an interface / suggest an interface to Simons World Map
	• Be able to hilight a row with a certain call sign....like V* or VK* or VK6DW and the row would turn Bright Green or somesuch
	•  Select continents by gridsquare, not by lat and long.  So an array of OF88 BD36 etc to define what we want, but this would need and
	interface like a map covered in grid squares that you highlight to produuce the array  string[] SA = new string[]{"AB12","AB13" etc}
